            <h1>What Technology Means to Me and My Journey With It</h1>
            <hr>
            <div class="blog_content">
                <p>I grew up surrounded by computers. My parents ran a computer shop in our neighborhood, and that place became a huge part of my childhood. I was always around monitors, keyboards, people printing school papers, and kids playing games. At the time, I didn’t think much of it. It just felt normal. But now that I look back, I realize how lucky I was to grow up in an environment like that.</p>

                <p>My dad was really into computers. He was the kind of person who would always explore new software, fix things on his own, and talk about tech like it was the most exciting thing in the world. He wasn’t just doing it for work, he actually enjoyed it. I think that’s what rubbed off on me. His passion made me curious, and it planted a seed that would grow over the years.</p>

                <p>Eventually, my parents gave me my own laptop. I was so happy because it felt like it was mine and mine alone. I wasn’t using one of the computers from the shop, I had my own little world now. That laptop was a huge part of my childhood and early teenage years. I didn’t start coding right away or dive into anything super technical. What I did was explore. I spent hours editing photos and videos for fun, messing around with different software, and diving into social media. I also got into gaming. That laptop became a space where I could be creative and learn at my own pace.</p>

                <p>Technology amazed me even back then. I loved how it could connect people, whether through messaging apps, online games, or sharing videos and posts. It made the world feel smaller in a good way. I could talk to people, join communities, and be part of something bigger than myself—even if I was just sitting in my room.</p>

                <p>As I got older and started thinking about what to study in college, IT just felt like the most natural choice. I wasn’t sure what kind of job I wanted at first, but I knew I liked working with computers. Out of all the programs and courses I could choose, IT felt the most right for me. It wasn’t a forced decision. It felt like the right fit.</p>

                <p>College was a new chapter. That’s where I finally learned coding, and it honestly felt like opening a new door. It was challenging at first and I had moments where I doubted myself or felt frustrated when things didn’t work, but there was also a huge sense of satisfaction whenever I figured something out. Coding showed me a new side of technology. It wasn’t just about using tools anymore. It was about creating them.</p>

                <p>Along the way, I also got to work on different projects, including websites, UI designs, and even apps for real-world problems. One project I’m looking forward to making is our capstone system, which is focused on emergency response for barangays. It made me realize how tech can go beyond personal use, it can solve real issues and help communities.</p>

                <p>What I love most about technology is how it makes things easier in our daily lives. Whether it’s finding directions, doing schoolwork, managing tasks, or even just relaxing with games or videos, it’s always there to help. It’s also always changing, which means there’s always something new to learn. That can be scary sometimes, but it also keeps things exciting.</p>

                <p>For someone like me who grew up without much, tech opened a lot of doors. I learned things through YouTube, free online courses, and just trial and error. I didn’t need expensive tools to get started, I just needed curiosity and a willingness to try.</p>

                <p>Now, as an upcoming fourth-year BSIT student, I’m more certain than ever that I chose the right path. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel proud of how far I’ve come. I’ve built websites, designed interfaces, helped lead school projects, and learned how to think like a developer. And it all started in a small computer shop with my dad, some noisy PCs, and a little bit of curiosity.</p>

                <p>Technology isn’t just a career choice for me. It’s something I grew up with, something that shaped how I see the world, and something I want to keep growing with. Whether I end up working as a developer, a designer, or something else in the tech world, I know I’ll be doing something I truly enjoy.</p>

                <p>If there’s anything I’ve learned from my journey, it’s that you don’t need to know everything right away. You just have to start. Try things, make mistakes, ask questions, and keep going. That’s what tech is to me,not just machines and code, but a way to explore, improve, and connect.</p>
